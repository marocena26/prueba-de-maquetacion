## 💾 Steps to follow to use this project on your computer:

> **NOTE:**  You need to have **Node JS** installed to run this project.

1. **Go to github.com/your-user/name-of-project**, **clone it** and do whatever you want, you can rename the repo, change the code, redeploy it to GitHub Pages...
2. **Finally** and for everything to work properly, **you must disable GitHub Pages and re-enable** it so that GitHub generates the new URL correctly.
3. Open it in your code editor.
4. Open a terminal and **install the local dependencies** by executing in the command terminal. Here are the ones I used to start my project:

```bash
npm install
```

The project has to be **started** every time we start programming, to do this we will execute the **command**:

```bash
npm start
```
After running `npm start` we can start editing all the files inside the src/ folder and program comfortably 💫
